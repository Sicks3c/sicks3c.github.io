&lt;p>In this writeup I will talk how I was able to find an IDOR in one of the largest Russian Company nothing other than Mail.ru
So approaching targets with huge scope can be frustrating sometimes since you don’t know where to start, For me I started looking in the main scope of &lt;code>Mail.ru Games&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>I fired up Burp&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Created an account&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Adding things in my cart&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Viewing the &lt;code>blog&lt;/code>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Creating a support ticket&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Before testing anything the ticket link looked kind of suspicious since it had &lt;code>/ticket/INTEGER&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*ErP1l5Al5QOK8_O5qfdP5w.png" alt="ticket">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let’s breakdown what can go wrong here
We have few parameters &lt;code>project_id/user_id/sign&lt;/code> and the ticket number
First thing I did is to remove the sign which is the signature and see if I can access it from an unauthenticated browser&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This looks easy no way that works right ?!!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:400/format:webp/0*jE5ml_v7U8wAzl9H" alt="img2">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well you’re wrong it worked and I was able to see my ticket and the conversation with the agent and also any attached file, I could also speak in the conversation as anonymous user 😁&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Further testing showed that changing the ticket number can allow viewing others ticket and changing the &lt;code>user_id&lt;/code> can allow viewing other ticket of that matched ID&lt;/p>
&lt;p>went and wrapped up a good report with &lt;a href="https://x.com/wld_basha">my friend&lt;/a> , and it was triaged within minutes an paid after few days&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:590/format:webp/1*WXV_nYEgIwyAQ0HnWSpizA.png" alt="bounty">&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="takeaways">Takeaways&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Don’t be afraid of diving the Main app it’s where all the juicy things exist&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Never underestimate yourself from finding bugs everyone has a unique view for the target&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Don’t be discouraged if you didn’t find a bug today tomorrow you will&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>I hope you enjoyed reading this and I will catch you in the next one&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Stay curious ❤&lt;/p></content></item><item><title>How I RCE'd the Largest RU Company</title><link>https://sicks3c.github.io/posts/how-i-rced-the-largest-ru-company/</link><pubDate>Thu, 19 Aug 2021 07:32:53 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://sicks3c.github.io/posts/how-i-rced-the-largest-ru-company/</guid><description>Hello Security Researchers

&lt;p>In this writeup I will explain how I was able to find RCE in &lt;code>Mail.ru&lt;/code> which is considered the world largest internet company,
Before starting to hack I was wondering on how I should approach the target and what most people would miss in the program, they have a huge scope which means it should be something out there sitting for me to find&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I started looking with the Favicon using this &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/yehgdotnet/b9dfc618108d2f05845c4d8e28c5fc6a">script&lt;/a>
Where I replace the link with the Mail.ru favicon, once generate I go to shodan.io and search for it&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*QaglJY1N4ZmUe7x65Wru3w.png" alt="img1">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now we search this hash on shodan.io with the &lt;code>http.favicon.hash&lt;/code> syntax&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*pmEgkNtfn3FhxTLg4U8Uiw.png" alt="img2">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now I went to see page by page and look for something suspicious with an unusual port number so I kept going till I found a host with port 8080
That has a Welcome to Nginx page&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once found I wanted to dig further on what’s going on, so I started to FUZZ directories and I found &lt;code>/static/shards/html&lt;/code> Publicly accessible and it looked Juicy&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From here I guessed that most of these hosts are Internal host and it will be difficult to reach them and I decided to &lt;a href="https://nmap.org/">Nmap&lt;/a> all of them
Found one that has a JDWP stands for (Java Debug Wire Protocol)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*1SOscii9_Beb5q4xEn-8-A.png" alt="nmap">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I started my research about this service / port and it turns out that it may be vulnerable to RCE by reading this &lt;a href="https://ioactive.com/hacking-java-debug-wire-protocol-or-how/">article&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>With the help of this &lt;a href="https://github.com/IOActive/jdwp-shellifier">jdwp-shellifier&lt;/a> I was able to show the RCE and the team triaged and paid &lt;code>$$$&lt;/code> since the server belongs to their infrastructure not the main assets&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*SRItvaGIGW_67n-mvXNBcA.png" alt="bounty">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Hope you enjoyed reading this and catch you in the next adventure&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In this write-up, I want to share with you a finding that I discovered in a public bug bounty program that ended up paying me 1K just using a single command on the terminal&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I won’t be able to disclose the name of the program since the leak was huge and they are still merging all the previous algorithm they used before to a new one and the deprecated API is still reachable&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The program exist in &lt;strong>Hackerone&lt;/strong> in more than a decade with big names on them, I was familiar with the services they offer since I was a user so I started to enumerate subdomain where I noticed a weird link that may actually hold sensitive data since they are parsing everything in URL path so my first approach was checking the &lt;a href="https://github.com/tomnomnom/waybackurls">waybackurls&lt;/a> since &lt;a href="https://x.com/TomNomNom">Tomnomnom&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>has a very unique tools I used it as follows&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>waybackurls requests.redacted.com&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was surprise with the amount of URLS that belongs to users with the tokens and I was like no way they’re valid right ?!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://europe1.discourse-cdn.com/flex005/uploads/ewelinkforum/original/2X/2/26f9b6464e5ae5981f1c2c02375c3f264e2b94ad.gif" alt="gif">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Guess I was wrong, I went to the API page and it looks like a simple POST request with the link leaked and a simple data via curl can do the Proof Of Concept using something like this&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*wfnBQlHJQu79hgOFYi_jyA.png" alt="poc">&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I tested in my own env and sent the report right away, It got paid under few days and the team started the fix&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:960/format:webp/1*JkJJxM8lYzpGWDgxsvER3w.png" alt="poc2">&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="takeways">Takeways&lt;/h3>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Never say that this program has a lot of know hackers and I won’t find a thing&lt;/li>
&lt;li>everyone has it’s unique approach to a target and you may see something that other didn’t&lt;/li>

Hello Security Researchers and Hackers
In this writeup I explain how I found 2 rXSS vulnerabilities in Angular using automation.
Tools Used Findomain for subdomain monitoring Wappalyzer for technology detection Discovery Process Received Telegram alert for new subdomains
Identified Angular 1.6 using Wappalyzer
Found reflected error parameter:
https://redacted.com/Home/Error?error=USER_NOT_AUTHORIZED
Exploitation Used payload from PayloadsAllTheThings:
